## Follow the template
1. Look for the index.jsp file in web/ folder

2. The index.jsp file includes 4 things:
  * **header** =>includes/
  * **navBar** =>components/
  * **sideBar** =>components/
  * **footer** =>includes/

3. The header, navBar and footer must be included for **every** page.

4. The **sideBar** should only be included in the Public Wall, My Account, Feedback and About Us page. Landing page, sign in, register and reset password page do not need the sideBar.

5. Please save any new pages you create in the pages/ folder.

6. JSP components should be saved in the components/ folder.


## Reminders
1. Keep in mind that we are going to expand and add more functions later, so please write code that is **easily scalable**.

2. Don't worry too much about formatting and design, those can be finished later. Just focus on getting the barebones JSP & HTML out first.
