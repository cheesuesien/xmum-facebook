# Introduction

There are a few version controlling tools before git. For instance, Subversion and Mercurial. But git has taken over the world because of its decentralised nature — everyone can have a copy of the source code. Or maybe because it is invented by Linus Torvalds, the same person who create the Linux Kernel, and is used in the kernel development over the Internet.

In most programs, saving means overwriting the existing file on your system. If you have a text file “abc.txt”, you change it and save it, and when you open the file again next time, it will be opended in the latest version you saved last time. The point is that you cannot go back in time to undo your changes. If you accidentally deleted something and saved it, that thing is lost forever. 

To avoid this from happening, some people makes copies of their file from time to time, e.g. “abc_copy.txt”, “abc_copy1.txt”, “abc_copy1_copy.txt”, and etc. The problem is that making copies is inefficient -- you are saving the entire file to save one or two changes. Another problem is that if you want to further backup your backup file, the whole thing will be a mess soon. 

The question is: “is there such a program that can help me tracking the changes made to files and maintaining all the different copies (or even copies of copies) of those files in an elegant way?” The answer is, of course, git. 

Under the hood, git tracks all the changes made to all the tracked file. It is important to realise that as git is a version-controlling tool. By that, it means that you have all the ability to “save” and “load” any previous versions of a file. Using Git to “save” a file is different from the ordinary save in other program. Therefore, by learning git, you are learning the way to do, undo, and redo changes made to a file. 

# Terminology

To start off, it is useful to understand some terms used in git.

1. A git repository is a git version-controlled working folder/directory. 
Note: A folder is a directory. Windows calls it a folder. Linux calls it a directory. Different name, but same concept. 

2. To clone means to download a git repository from a server onto your device. 
Recall that a repository is essentially a directory. When you clone a git repository, all its files are cloned into your current/specified directory. E.g. if you are cloning a git repository called hello-world into your current directory, after cloning you will find the directory called hello-world inside your current directory. 

3. To init means to start treating the current directory as a git repository. 
This is used when you want to start version-controlling files in your directory. 

1. To commit means to take a snapshot. (Commiting changes)
Use `revert` to undo commits. 

2. A branch is where your works are isolated in another version of the repository.
Think it as another branch of a tree. By branching out, it means maintaining another versions/copies of a repository. 

3. To checkout a branch means switching to that branch. 
Your changes are only affecting the files in the current branch. Files in other branch will not be affected.

4. A head is where you are working on (inside the current branch).
Think it as a pointer showing you where you are now working on (either inside a branch or a master branch).

5. A master branch is your main branch.
Think it as the trunk of a tree. It is what left when you do not have any branches. You should note that a head is not the master branch. If you switch/checkout to another branch, your head will be at that branch. 

7. To fetch means to download changes from the source.

8. To merge means to combine two things into one (e.g. two branches into one). 

6. To pull means to fetch and merge. 

9. To push means to upload your changes to a remote origin. 

10. A remote branch is a branch resides not on your local machine.

10. A remote origin is where you clone/pull a repository from. 
Or it can be where you maintain your repository on a server.

9. To stage a change means getting ready to commit. 
You are required to stage a change before making a commit. This is important to group related changes into one commit. When you review back your git log or history, you want your history to be clear and readable. Think of each commit as a topic.

To unstage a change, use the `reset` command. 

10. To track and untrack file means adding or removing the file from being version controlled. 
This is important if there are files meant not to be shared with others. 

11. A log is where you can view back all your branches along with all their commited changes. 
Think it as the timeline records of your project evolution over time. Trust me, it is amazing to see it in action. 

12. A tag is a marker given to a snapshot because that version is significant. 
Often, a tag is used to mark the release version of a software. 

# Getting Started

This will get you started using git. I'll recommend download the git from the official [git website][Git Official Website URL] and use git from the command line. You are free to use any third-party git client with graphical user intergace as you wish. On Windows, [TortoiseGit][TortoiseGit Official Website] provides a good integration into the system. Every git client should work well with Gitlab.

1. Clone a project from the server.\
Copy the ssh or https link of a git repository. Then `git clone URL`.

2. Make a branch.\
`git branch <BRANCH_NAME>`. E.g. `git branch jiahong` will create a branch named `jiahong`. Then `git checkout jiahong`. (Shortcut, `git checkout -b jiahong` does these two things at once.) Then `git push -u origin <BRANCH_NAME>` to push your branch to the server so that others will know what you are working on.\

3. Work on your own branch.\
Simply edit your local files. Save it. Just do the normal things!

4. Stage and commit often\
Whenever you want to create a checkpoint, stage the changes and commit them. `git add <FILE>` to track and stage changes. `git commit -m "commit_message"` to commit.

5. Push changes to remote branch.\
`git push -u origin <BRANCH_NAME>`(for first time push, use the -u flag. Next time, just use `git push`). This will automatically create a remote branch with the same name, if it doesn't already exist.

6. Merge into the master.\
When you are finished working on your branch, you can then merge into the master branch.\
First navigate to the master branch `git checkout master`(you should make sure your master branch is tracking the remote master branch - if it is, you will see this message "Your branch is ... with 'origin/master'". If you don't see this message, then do this `git branch -u origin/master`.)\
Then make sure your local master is up-to-date with the remote master using `git pull origin master`.\
Then merge your branch into the master using `git merge <BRANCH_NAME>`.\
Finally, push your local master to the origin master using `git push origin master` or simply `git push`.

# Common Workflow

1. Navigate to the branch you are currently working on using `git checkout <BRANCH_NAME>`. E.g. `git checkout css`

1. Pull changes into your local repo using `git pull origin <BRANCH_NAME>`. If there are any merge conflicts, you have to resolve them manually.\
E.g. `git pull origin css` will fetch the css branch of the remote origin repo and merge any changes into your local css branch.\
`git pull` is a combination of `git fetch <remote> <branch>` and `git merge <remote>/<branch>`. \
You can do this often even when working on your own branch to view changes done by others. Use `git diff` to view the changes.

2. Follow steps 3-6 of 'Getting Started.'

# Commit Messages

1. Use keywords to make it clear and concise.\
E.g. "Add <FILE_A>", "Add the function core()", "Refactor the name from ABC to ABD", "Update...", "Fix...".
